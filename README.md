You need to have npm installed to run this. If you don't have it, the easiest way to get it is by installing Node.js

Once you have npm installed, open terminal and navigate to the project folder.
Then run the following commands in order
- npm install
- npm run dev
- npm start

This should install the required modules and package the javascript required for the site to load.

The site should start automatically at the end of the last command. If it doesn't or if you happen to close it, you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/
